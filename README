Usage:

startworker <path-to-config-file>

The Config file is a YAML formatted file that defines a list of queues.

- Queue: [name]  					#define a new queue with 'name'
  Host: [hostname | ip address] 	#address of the queueing server
  [Job | Service | Files] 			#definition of a job or file transfer
- Queue: [name2]
  Host ..[hostname2 | ip address2]
  ...

In the config.yaml file a job is defined as

   Job:
	 executable [name] 	#Path to the executable to execute
	 output	[path]		#File to stream the standard output to 
	 error  [path]		#File to stream the standard error to
	 arguments [list of arguments] #List of arguments
	 environment [list of name:value pairs] #List of environment variables
	 workingdirectory [path] 	#Path of the working directory
	 queue [name] 				#Name of the queue of the remote compute resource
	 walltimelimit [number]		#Maximum Time the job can run
	 numberofprocesses [number]	#Number of processes to start
	 spmdvariation	[pe]		#SPMD environment. Implemented as parallel environment in SGE
	 totalcpucount [number]		#Number of CPUs requested for this job (second parameter of -pe)
	 

When Specifying a Job, this section should be followed by a Service.

	Service:
      Name: eddie 
      Resource: [SGE|CONDOR|SLURM|FORK|PBS] #resource type to use
      Connection: [SSH|LOCAL] #connection type
      Host: [host]  	#Hostname or IP address
      UserId: [name]    #Name of the user
      UserKey: [path]   #Path to the ssh key 
      Pollingtime: [number]    #Time between polls

For each queue either a 'JOB' or a 'FILES' section should be specified. A 'FILES' section contains file transfers.

	Files:
    - Target:
       URL:  [target URL]  #Target URL. Either sftp://[hostname]/[path] or file://localhost/[path]
       UserId: [name] 	   #User name
       UserKey: [path]     #Path the ssh key
       Password [password] #Password
      Source:
       URL:  [source URL] 	#See target
       UserId: [name] 		#See target
       UserKey: [path] 		#See target
       Password: [password] #See target
    - Target:
      ...
      Source: 
      ...
